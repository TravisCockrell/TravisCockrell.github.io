<h2>Pelicans rough start</h2>
<p>Going into this season, Pelicans were looked at one of the most exciting teams with having Zion from the draft and the Lakers young core we received in the trade of Anthony Davis. 
  The preseason made it even more convincing for the Pelicans. However, the start of the season has been rough. Starting the season with Zion out from a torn meniscus was really depressing.
  It started the Pelicans off with a disadvantage. Then, the team needed to form their chemistry. That can take awhile especially with such young players like ours.
  SO with no Zion and no chemistry, the team has not played to their expectations. Thankfully, its early in the season and they are starting to find their groove.
  With Brandon Ingram putting up career numbers, Lonzo showing spurts of what he truly can bring, J.J shoooting outstanding, and Zion coming back soon, you have alot to look forward to knowing its so early in the season. .

<h3>rebounds</h3>

<p> Another big reason for our early struggles are rebounds. We allow more offensive rebounds than 27 other teams in the league. Considering Derrick Favors is only 6'9 and jahlil isn't great at rebounds either,
  I am not suprised about this tsruggle. Not to mention Nicola Melli is undersized and is a terrible rebounder.I believe Coach Gentry should should be putting bigger lineup.</p>
